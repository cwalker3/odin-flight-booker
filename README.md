This project is part of [The Odin Project](Theodinproject.com)'s Ruby on Rails curriculum.

The goal of this project was to create a simple app where the user can search for flights, and create a (fake) booking. It involved the use of nested forms. The project page can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-flight-booker).

This project is complete according to the project specs but I will come back in the future to style it and add more features.
